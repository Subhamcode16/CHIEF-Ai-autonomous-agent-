The Correct Mental Model (Short Answer)

After the button is clicked once, the agent enters “Active / Autonomous Mode.”
From that point on, any new task or conflict triggers an automatic re-plan — without clicking the button again.

1️⃣ Primary Action Button (MOST IMPORTANT)
Current (Typical)

Let Chief Plan Your Day

✅ Keep it — but add context after click

Before click (Idle state)

Let Chief Plan My Day

Micro-copy below button

You’re delegating control. Chief will manage your schedule until paused.

Judges instantly understand: this is a handoff.

2️⃣ Post-Click State (Autonomous Mode Activated)

Immediately after clicking, show a state confirmation banner.

🔵 Autonomous Mode Banner
🧠 Autonomous Mode Active
Chief is now managing your schedule and will adjust it as new tasks or conflicts appear.


This single sentence does MASSIVE work.

3️⃣ Agent Status Indicator (Persistent)

Top-right or header area:

Status States

🟢 Autonomous Mode: Active

🟡 Planning…

🔵 Monitoring changes

⏸ Paused

This turns the agent into a living system, not a one-shot tool.

4️⃣ Task Entry UI (THIS IS KEY)

When the user adds a new task while autonomy is active, show inline feedback.

After task is added:

Chief is adjusting your schedule…

Then:

✅ Task scheduled automatically at 3:00–4:00pm

And optionally:

Reason: deadline proximity and available focus time.

This proves:

No button click

No prompt

Automatic action

5️⃣ Decision Log Header Copy

At the top of the Decision Log page/panel:

Decision Log
Every scheduling decision Chief makes — and why.

Subtext:

These decisions happen automatically while Autonomous Mode is active.

Judges now know:

“This is not manual.”

6️⃣ Decision Card Language (Consistent Framing)
Decision Title Format

Decision: Scheduled Investor Pitch Prep

Reasoning Label (Important)

❌ “AI Analysis”
❌ “Model Output”

✅ Why Chief acted

This keeps it human and executive.

7️⃣ Re-Planning Event Copy (When Change Happens)

When a new task or conflict triggers a re-plan:

Small toast / inline message

🔄 Schedule updated automatically
Chief adjusted your day to accommodate a new priority.

Optional expandable:

View decision →

This line is a judge magnet.

8️⃣ Autonomy Toggle (Safety + Trust)
Toggle Label

Autonomous Mode

Toggle ON helper text

Chief will actively manage your schedule and make decisions for you.

Toggle OFF helper text

Chief will stop making changes until reactivated.

This reassures judges about control.

9️⃣ Empty State (Before Activation)

When the app loads fresh:

Chief is standing by.
Activate Autonomous Mode to delegate your day.

This frames the agent as ready but respectful.

🔑 One Sentence You Should Reuse Everywhere

“Chief acts automatically once you delegate control.”

Repeat this idea across:

Button microcopy

Banner

Decision log

Demo narration

Consistency = credibility.

🧠 Judge Psychology Check (Why This Works)

With this wording, judges will subconsciously register:

Add a preferences textbox that allows the user to write the preferences it will be one time the gent will remember it thoughout the user session. 
For example:

Deep work preferred in the morning
Avoid meetings after 6:00 PM
At least one break mid-day

Everytime setting up a calender it should set this preferences and based on that it should rechedule
